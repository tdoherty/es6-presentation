    <li>First they said JS couldn't be useful for building "rich Internet apps"</li>
    <li>Then they said it couldn't be fast</li>
    <li>Then they said it couldn't be fixed</li>
    <li>Then they said it couldn't do multicore/GPU</li>
    <li>Wrong every time!</li>
    <li>My advice: always bet on JS</li>
